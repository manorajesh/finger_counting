# Finger Counting
### Inspired by the problem:
Count up to 2000 on your fingers (consecutively) without double counting on the thumb or the pinky. Which finger will the number 2000 end up on? Count only on one hand.

There is probably a way to figure this out without repeated addition like I did, but I like this more.
